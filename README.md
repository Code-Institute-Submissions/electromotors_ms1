# Electromotors  
## Sales and repair of Electric Motors
## How can we solve YOUR problem today?

 This is a website developed with the intent of making life easier for both experienced and novice machine operators and repair/maintenance personnel.   
 It's raison d'etre is to allow the user to make immediate contact to establish either the availability of replacement machinery or to explore the feasabilty of repair to such items.    
 It features a general yet broad content of what Electromotors can do to solve a problem without the user necessarilty needing to understand the complexity of what they are trying to fix.  
 The ultimate objective is to develop a stand-alone APP eventually in conjunction with the website, to improve real-time responses in the future.
